<h2>THE DIRECTOR'S VADE MECUM.</h2>

<ul class="none">
<li><i>Question.</i> What is your
duty as a Director?</li>

<li><i>Answer.</i> To give my name
to a prospectus.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Is there any necessary
formality before making this
donation?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Yes; I am to accept a
certain number of qualifying
shares in the company obtaining
the advantage of my
directorial services.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Need you pay for these
shares?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> With proper manipulation,
certainly not.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> What other advantages
would you secure by becoming
a Director?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> A guinea an attendance.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Anything else?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> A glass of sherry and a
sandwich.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> What are your duties at
a Board Meeting?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> To shake hands with the
Secretary, and to sign an
attendance book.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> What are your nominal
duties?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Have not the faintest
idea.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Would it be right to
include in your nominal duties
the protection of the interests
of the shareholders?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> As likely as not.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Would it be overstating
the case to say that thousands
and thousands of needy persons
are absolutely ruined by the
selfish inattention of a company's
direction?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Not at all&mdash;possibly understating
it.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> I suppose you never read
a prospectus to which you put
your name?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Never.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Nor willingly wish to
ruin any one?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> No; why should I?</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> You are guilty of gross
ignorance and brutal indifference?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Quite so.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> And consequently know
that, according to the view of
the Judges, you are above the
law?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> That is so.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> And may therefore do
what you like, without any
danger to your own interests?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> To be sure.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> And consequently will
do what you best please, in
spite of anything, and anybody?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Why, certainly.</li>

<p class="center"><i>A Morality (adapted from the "Merchant of

<blockquote><p>
["The music on the Embankment during the
pressman's dinner-hour is a much more important
matter than it seems to be. It would be a most
beneficial institution for all indoor labourers; for
it is not the long hours of labour&mdash;though they
are bad enough&mdash;so much as its monotony that
makes it so wearisome."&mdash;<i>Mr. James Payn in
"Our Note Book."</i>]

<p class="i4"><i>Lorenzo.</i> Sweetheart, let's in; they may expect our coming.</p>
<p>And yet no matter:&mdash;why should we go in?</p>
<p>The Toffs at last, have had compassion on us,</p>
<p>Within the house, or office, mewed too long,</p>
<p>And bring our music forth into the air.</p>
<p class="i20">[<i>They take a seat.</i></p>
<p>How bright the sunshine gleams on this Embankment!</p>
<p>Here will we sit, and let the sounds of music</p>
<p>Creep in our ears: soft green and Summer sunlight</p>
<p>Become the touches of sweet harmony.</p>
<p>Sit, <span class="sc">Jessica</span>: look, how this green town-garden</p>
<p>Is thickly crowded with the young and old:</p>
<p>There's not the smallest child which thou behold'st</p>
<p>But by his movements shows his young heart sings,</p>
<p>As though poor kids were young eye'd cherubim:</p>
<p>Such love of music lives in simple souls;</p>
<p>But whilst grim pedants and fanatics sour</p>
<p>Have power to stop, they will not let us hear it!</p>
<p class="i20">[<i>Musicians tune up.</i></p>
<p>Hullo! The <i>Intermezzo</i>. Like a hymn</p>
<p>With sweeter touches charming to the ear,</p>
<p>The soul's drawn home by music.</p>

<p>For do but note a wild and wanton mob</p>
<p>Of rough young rascals, like unbroken colts,</p>
<p>Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and blaring loud,</p>
<p>Which shows the hot condition of their blood;</p>
<p>If they, perchance, but hear a brass-band sound,</p>
<p>Or harp and fiddle duet touch their ears,</p>
<p>Or even <i>Punch's</i> pan-pipe, or shrill "squeaker,"</p>
<p>You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,</p>
<p>Their wandering eyes turned to an earnest gaze,</p>
<p>By the sweet power of music: therefore poets</p>
<p>Tell us old Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods,</p>
<p>Since naught so blockish, hard, insensible,</p>
<p>But music for the time doth change his nature.</p>
<p>The man who would keep music to himself,</p>
<p>Grudging the mob all concord of sweet sounds,</p>
<p>Is fit for Bedlam, not the County Council!</p>
<p>The motions of his spirit are dull as night,</p>
<p>And his affections cold as Arctic bergs.</p>

<p>Where tours may be contracted for to Borderland and Spooks;</p>
<p>And those who yearn to mix with ghosts have only got to go</p>
<p>And talk, as I conversed, with <span class="sc">Stead</span> for half an hour or so.</p>

  <div class="poem"> <div class="stanza">
<p>The ghosts have got a paper too, the <i>Borderland</i> I spoke of,</p>
<p>Where raps and taps are registered that scoffers make a joke of:</p>
<p>A medium's magazine it is, a ghostly gazetteer</p>
<p>Produced by <span class="sc">William Thomas Stead</span>, the Julianic seer.</p>
<p>And everything that dead men do to help the men who live,</p>
<p>The chains they clank, the sighs they heave, the warnings that they give,</p>
<p>The coffin-lids they lift at night when folk are tucked in bed,</p>
<p>Are all set down in black and white by <span class="sc">William Thomas Stead</span>.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>While wide-awake he sees such shapes as others merely dream on;</p>
<p>For instance there is <span class="sc">Julia</span>, a sort of female dæmon;</p>
<p>Like some tame hawk she stoops to him, she perches on his wrist&mdash;</p>
<p>In life she was a promising, a lady journalist;</p>
<p>And now that death has cut her off she leaves the ghostly strand</p>
<p>And turns her weekly copy out by guiding <span class="sc">William's</span> hand.</p>
<p>Yet, oh, it makes me writhe like one who sits him down on tin tacks</p>
<p>To note that happy ghost's contempt for grammar and for syntax.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Well, well, I called on <span class="sc">Stead</span>, you know; a doctor's talk of diet is,</p>
<p>And <span class="sc">Stead's</span> was of his psychic food as cure for my anxieties.</p>
<p>I thought I'd take a chair to sit (it looked to me quite common) on,</p>
<p>"You can't sit there," observed the Sage; "that's merely a phenomenon."</p>
<p>Two ladies, as I entered, seemed expressing of their gratitudes</p>
<p>For help received to Mr. <span class="sc">Stead</span> in sentimental attitudes;</p>
<p>They saw me, pirouetted twice, then vanished with a high kick.</p>
<p>"It's nothing," said the Editor; "they are not real, but psychic."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>These things, I own, surprised me much; I fidgetted uneasily;</p>
<p>"Why, bless the man, he's had a shock!" said Mr. <span class="sc">Stead</span>, quite breezily.</p>
<p>"<i>We</i> do these things the whole year round, it's merely knack to do them;</p>
<p>A man who does them every day gets quite accustomed to them.</p>
<p>This room of mine is full of ghosts,"&mdash;it sounded most funereal&mdash;</p>
<p>"I've only got to say the word to make them all material.</p>
<p>I'll say it promptly, if you wish; they cannot well refuse me."</p>
<p>But my eagerness had vanished, and I begged him to excuse me.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"Now <span class="sc">Julia</span>," he continued, "is in many ways a rum one,</p>
<p>But, whatever else they say of her, they can't say she's a dumb one.</p>
<p>She speaks&mdash;she's speaking now," he said. "I wonder what she'll tell us.</p>
<p>What's that? She says she likes your looks; she wants to make me jealous."</p>
<p>That gave me pause, and made me think 'twas fully time I went; it is</p>
<p>A fearful thing to fascinate these bodiless non-entities.</p>
<p>Of course when people go to Rome they act like folk at Rome, you know,</p>
<p>But flirting didn't suit my book&mdash;I've got a wife at home, you know.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Well, next I felt a gust of wind, "That's Colonel <span class="sc">Bones</span>," my host said;</p>
<p>"He's dropped his helmet" (think of that, a helmet on a ghost's head).</p>
<p>"I don't much care," he whispered this, "in fact, I can't endure him;</p>
<p>Dragoons do use such awful words; I've tried in vain to cure him."</p>
<p>I ventured to suggest to <span class="sc">Stead</span> that rather than be bluffed I</p>
<p>Would make this cursing soldier-ghost turn out in psychic mufti;</p>
<p>He couldn't drop his helmet then, nor threaten with his sabre.</p>
<p>"I've tried to," said the Editor, "it's only wasted labour.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"I've sought advice," continued <span class="sc">Stead</span>, "from <span class="sc">Cantuar</span> and <span class="sc">Ebor</span>,</p>
<p>They hinted that they couldn't stand a she-ghost and a he-bore.</p>
<p>I tried to get a word or two from men of arts and letters,</p>
<p>They said they drew the line at Spooks who made a noise with fetters.</p>
<p>And when I talked of bringing men and ghostly shapes together</p>
<p>The Bishops tapped their foreheads and conversed about the weather.</p>
<p>In fact"&mdash;he grew quite petulant&mdash;"in all this world's immensity</p>
<p>I'd back the Bench of Bishops to beat the rest in density."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And so he talked, till suddenly&mdash;(perhaps he's talking still;</p>
<p>In talking of his own affairs, he has a wondrous skill)&mdash;</p>
<p>There came a noise, as if Old <span class="sc">Bones</span> had let off all his blanks at once,</p>
<p>As if a thousand theorists were turning all their cranks at once;</p>
<p>It seemed to lift me off my legs, and seize me by the hair,</p>
<p>And sweep me mute but terrified through all the spook-filled air.</p>
<p>And, when I got my senses back, I vowed no more to tread</p>
<p>The paths that lead to Borderland, nor ask advice of <span class="sc">Stead</span>.</p>

<h3>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h3>

<p><i>Pietro Ghisleri</i> is another success for that charming writer
<span class="sc">Marion Crawford</span>. The style is everything. The story is not of so
thrilling a nature as to be absorbing, but it is sufficiently interesting&mdash;for
the Baron, at least, with whom M.C.&mdash;"Master of his Craft"&mdash;is
a great favourite. "Odd, though," murmurs the Baron to himself,
and he seldom murmurs about anything; "odd that a writer
like our <span class="sc">Marion</span> should, in Vol. II., p. 35, pen such a sentence as
this: "There are plenty of others whom you may care for more than
I." Of course the author intends <i>Maddalena del' Armi</i>, who
utters these words, to convey to her listener and to the reader that
"There are plenty of others for whom you may care more than (you
care) for me." How does "than I" get into this sentence, unless it
is to mean "There are plenty of others for whom you may care more
than I care for them"&mdash;<i>quod est absurdum</i>." It is unfortunate that
the pivot on which the plot turns is so highly improbable as to be
almost impossible, for is it not most unlikely that any Catholic,
educated or uneducated, should ever <i>write</i> her confession to her
confessor, and send it by post, instead of going to him, and making it
by word of mouth? She must have known that, in so doing, she
was making no confession at all, <i>i.e.</i>, in the restrictedly religious
sense of the word. While she was about it, she might as well have
inclosed a stamped and addressed envelope for the absolution to be
sent by return. This is the hinge of the story; and it is a very weak
one. Mr. <span class="sc">Crawford</span> recognises this when his other characters
casually discuss the probability of <i>Adèle's</i> having done such a thing.
However, grant this, which is almost as easily done as granting
superhuman strength to a Ouidaesque hero, and the book&mdash;in three
of <span class="sc">Macmillan's</span> blue volumes&mdash;is fascinating. Such is the candid
opinion of <span style="float: right"><span class="sc">The Baron de Book-worms</span>.</span><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h2>THE MAN MAKES THE TAILOR.</h2>

<h4>(<i>Fragment from a Seasonable Romance.</i>)</h4>

<p>It was towards the close of the London season of 1893 that a man
in a strange garb was seen at an early hour in the East End of
London. He attracted considerable attention. It was a rough part
of the City, still, those who lived there were conventional in their
costume. They wore black coats, and there was a certain respectability
about their hats. But the man to whom we refer was eccentric
in the extreme. His straw hat was worn at the back of his head,
his cut-away coat was thrown open, showing a huge, collarless
coloured cotton shirt. He had flannel trousers tucked into digger's
boots. No one knew whence he came, whither he was going.</p>

<p>"Have you noticed him?" asked the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir," replied the Police Constable, "he's got white hands,
so if he belongs to the dangerous classes, he is a smasher, or a forger,
or something genteel in that line."</p>

<p>"Well, keep your eye upon him."</p>

<p>"I will, Sir."</p>

<p>And the strange-looking person continued his way. As he walked
through the City, the merchants regarded him with surprise, but
there were those amongst the stockbrokers who seemed to receive
him with recognition.</p>

<p>"I fancy I have seen the Johnnie somewhere before," observed one
Member of the House to another. "I am almost sure I know the cut
of his suit."</p>

<p>And the man walked on until he reached Knightsbridge. There
he was stopped by an elderly, well-dressed, well-to-do individual,
who had evidently just come up from the country. The two pedestrians
started back when they met face to face.</p>

<p>"What are you doing in that hideous disguise?" asked the senior
of the junior.</p>

<p>"It is no disguise, father," was the reply; "it is only the customary
get up of a young man of fashion between the hours of nine
and eleven when he proposes to walk in the park."</p>

<p>And, with these words, the strange apparition crossed over the
road, and entered Rotten Row. And here he was soon lost in a
crowd quite as eccentrically garbed as himself.</p>

over an Annual Meeting, and draw my fees. What more <i>can</i>
I do?</li>

<li><i>Chair.</i> Certainly. If I don't sell out in the meantime. And

<h2>THE FRENCH WOLF AND THE SIAMESE LAMB.</h2>

<h4><i>An Old Fable with a New Setting.</i></h4>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>A little lamb lived by a flowing stream.</p>
<p class="i2">A great temptation, when the heat was torrid,</p>
<p>To thirsty souls that water's limpid gleam.</p>
<p class="i2">At least so thought a Wolf, of aspect horrid,</p>
<p>Who, having for some time abstained and fasted,</p>
<p>Desired to learn how lamb&mdash;and water&mdash;tasted.</p>
<p>He felt with pinching want his paunch was pining,</p>
<p>Early he'd lunched, so longed the more for dining.</p>
<p class="i2">A Cochin China rooster, lank and thin,</p>
<p class="i2">Or something indigestible from Tonquin,</p>
<p>For a big, sharp-set Wolf, are snacks, not meals;</p>
<p>So down the sparkling river Lupus steals,</p>
<p class="i2">Quite uninvited, but intent on forage,</p>
<p class="i2">Fronting the fleecy flocks with wondrous courage;</p>
<p>For whether in the Southdowns, or Siam,</p>
<p>By the near Medway, or the far Menam,</p>
<p>Your Wolf is most courageous&mdash;with your Lamb!</p>
<p>With joy the Lamb he spied, then, growling, said,</p>
<p class="i2">"Sirrah! how dare you thus disturb my drink?"</p>
<p>The Lamb, in answer, meekly bowed its head&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">"<i>I</i> trouble not the water, Sir, I think,</p>
<p>Particularly as I'm sure you'll see</p>
<p>It flows&mdash;observe the drift&mdash;from you to me!</p>
<p>You're welcome in the stream to slake your thirst,</p>
<p>But, may I just observe, <i>I was here first!</i>"</p>
<p>"Oh! you chop logic!" cried the angry brute.</p>
<p class="i2">"I can chop, too:&mdash;you've done me other wrong.</p>
<p>Young Mutton, best with <i>me</i> not to dispute!</p>
<p class="i2">You've given me already too much tongue.</p>
<p>Are <i>you</i> the home-born boss of all Siam,</p>
<p>Of fleet Mekong, and many-creek'd Menam?"</p>
<p>Mildly young woolly-face replied, "I <i>am</i>!"</p>
<p class="i2">His optics orientally oblique,</p>
<p class="i2">Rolling in manner sheepish, soft, and meek.</p>
<p>"Oh, <i>are</i> you?" snarled the Wolf. "<i>We</i>'ll see about it!</p>
<p class="i2">'Twixt Western Wolf and Oriental Lamb</p>
<p class="i2">Equality is a preposterous flam:</p>
<p>Do you&mdash;as Tonquin did&mdash;presume to doubt it?</p>
<p class="i2">Fraternity? Well, I'm your elder brother;</p>
<p class="i2">And Liberty&mdash;to you&mdash;means nought but bother.</p>
<p>See, silly-face?" "Well, no," the Lamb replied,</p>
<p>"Such reciprocity seems all one side.</p>
<p>Not six o' one and half a dozen o' 'tother!"</p>
<p>"Pooh!" snapped the Wolf.  "Logic's clear <i>terra firma</i></p>
<p class="i2">Is not for Lambkin, but for Wolf or Lion.</p>
<p class="i2">If you such little games with me should try on,</p>
<p>I'd treat you&mdash;well, as Bull did little Burmah.</p>
<p>I have imperative claims; I'm going to state 'em</p>
<p>With lupine brevity in an ultimatum.</p>
<p class="i2">That&mdash;after some two days&mdash;must stand as Law;</p>
<p class="i2">If after that you give me any jaw,</p>
<p class="i2">My little Mutton&mdash;well, beware my maw!"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i12"><span class="sc">Moral.</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">At Daly's.</span>&mdash;The Comedy <i>Love in Tandem</i>
ought to have been in three shorter Acts.
Mr. <span class="sc">Lewis</span> excellent, so is Mrs. <span class="sc">Gilbert</span>, who
has not more than ten words to say, but a lot to
act. Spanish widow also good. Mr. <span class="sc">Bourchier</span>
is a marvellous example of the
"Walking Gentleman," being perpetually
on the move. It is gratifying to see him sit
down for even a few seconds. Like the engineer
of the penny steamboat in the burlesque
of <i>Kenilworth</i>, he "has very much to larn";
but this fact need not discourage him, any
more than it did Mr. <span class="sc">Henry Irving</span>, according
to Mr. <span class="sc">Percy Fitzgerald's</span> recently
published book of Irvingite Recollections, at
the commencement of his career. Miss
<span class="sc">Rehan</span> is, <i>par excellence</i>, the life and soul of
the piece; and when there has been, in her
absence, a dull moment or two, she re-enters
and Rehanimates the whole.</p>

are the Royal carriages and Royal personages to receive me?"
Admiral <span class="sc">Commerell</span> steered himself along the main roads, and

offing," he reported to the Emperor. "I hope," returned His
Imperial Majesty, with a smile, "that this sort of thing doesn't
offing happen." Everybody in convulsions of laughter, which just
filled up the time till the appearance on the scene of the Duke of
<span class="sc">Connaught</span> on the top of the cabin, in the full uniform of a General
of the Horse Marines. "You're too punctual by half a minute,"
called out the Duke to the Admiral. Then the Admiral piped his
eye, and the Royalties lighted cigarettes. "Here are the carriages!
step in!" quoth the Duke. "Aha!" cried the Emperor gaily, in
his perfect English. "Here is the carriage and the 'oss, so now we
shall be borne by the 'oss to <i>Os-borne</i>!" Every one in convulsions,
and amid roars of laughter the Duke and the Emperor drove off.</p>

<h2 class="sans">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

<p><i>House of Lords, Monday, July 24.</i>&mdash;Haven't heard much of
House of Lords this Session. Will take the floor presently, and
show Commons how Legislation should be conducted. For weeks
and months they've been slaving round Home-Rule Bill. Noble
Lords, with fuller experience, and heaven-born aptitude, undertake
to polish it off in a week. Meanwhile have had less work than usual
to do. Might even have made long Summer holiday. Patriotically
insisted upon meeting four times a week, to show, to whom it may
concern, that at least they are ready for work.</p>

<p>To-night suddenly blazed forth with amazing vigour. Old friend
<span class="sc">Evelyn Baring</span>, taking his seat under new style, Lord <span class="sc">Cromer</span>,
agreeably surprised; House almost full; Opposition in high feather;
cheered <span class="sc">Cadogan</span> and the <span class="sc">Markiss</span> with rare enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"I suppose the question is either the Church or the Land?" said
<span class="sc">Cromer</span>, looking up his Orders of the Day. "Heard in Egypt those
were only subjects that made you sit up."</p>

<p>"There's one other," said <span class="sc">Carrington</span>, to whom remark was
addressed; "though you will say it practically comes to the same
thing. It's Mr. G. Anything connected with him ruffles House
with sudden storm. Mr. G. made <span class="sc">Houghton</span> Lord Lieutenant of
Ireland. <span class="sc">Houghton</span> a charming fellow; popular in both camps;
but being Mr. G.'s selection for the Viceroyalty, we&mdash;I mean they&mdash;are
bound to go for him."</p>

<p>Went for him to-night hammer and tongues. <span class="sc">Cadogan</span>, not
usually a peer of bloodthirsty aspect, clenched his teeth with
ominous vigour when he discovered <span class="sc">Houghton</span> was not present.
Had sent him special invitation, he explained. Had even gone so
far as to leave to him choice of date for his execution. "And now,"
cried <span class="sc">Cadogan</span>, glaring round the appalled House, "his Excellency
is not here!"</p>

<p>His absence commented on with towering vigour. Lord Lieutenant's
procedure, in his dealing with addresses, "dishonest, dishonourable,
discreditable to all concerned," said <span class="sc">Cadogan</span>, by way of final shot,
intended to sink whole Ministerial Bench.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Markiss</span>, not to be outdone, denounced Mr. G. as "a despot," and
his colleagues in the Government "a well-trained company of
mutes." As for something Lord <span class="sc">Spencer</span> had said, <span class="sc">Markiss</span>
described it as "a pure invention," which is much politer than Mr.
<span class="sc">Mantalini's</span> way of referring to similar lapse as "a demnition
lie." House sat as late as half-past six, and went off home in high
good humour. "Quite a long time since we wet our spears," said
the <span class="sc">Markiss</span>. "Just as well sometime, dear <span class="sc">Toby</span>, to show you
fellows in the Commons what we can do."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;In Commons Financial Clause to Home-Rule Bill
passed Second Reading.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Don't Keir Hardie</span> on again
with fresh inquiry as to misadventure to one <span class="sc">Arthur Walker</span> on
day of Royal Wedding. Mr. <span class="sc">Walker</span> (of London) it appears had
difficulty with mounted officer in command of company of troops.
Officer says that when ordered to fall back <span class="sc">Walker</span> seized his horse's
rein. ARTHUR says "Walker!"; didn't do anything of the sort.
That remains in dispute. What is clear is that <span class="sc">Walker</span> got slight
scalp wound, inflicted by the warrior's sword. <span class="sc">Don't Keir Hardie</span>
wants sworn inquiry into case. <span class="sc">Campbell-Bannerman</span> puts whole
case in nutshell. "An accident," he says, "a regrettable accident;
entirely owing to fact of the sharp edge of the sword meeting the
man's head, instead of the flat edge."</p>

<p>That was all; but <span class="sc">Walker</span> seems to think it was enough.
Carried out on a larger scale, before and since Waterloo, similar
accidents have had even more direful results. But <span class="sc">Campbell-Bannerman</span>,
by voice and manner, succeeded in throwing into
explanation an amount of conviction that communicated itself to
House, and even quietened <span class="sc">Don't Keir Hardie</span>. The choice of the
word "meeting" was perhaps most exquisite touch in answer.
Without venturing upon assertion, it conveyed impression that
responsibility for regrettable occurrence was fully shared by Mr.
<span class="sc">Walker</span>. Meeting implies advance from either side. To accomplish
the contact, Mr. <span class="sc">Walker's</span> head must have advanced in the direction
of the sword, which at the moment happened to be going the other
way, unfortunately with the sharp edge to the front. Hence,
between the two, the abrasion of Mr. <span class="sc">Walker's</span> skull.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span>
<p><span class="sc">Campbell-Bannerman</span> did not add another word, but everyone
who knows his kindness of heart will understand his unuttered wish
that when in future <span class="sc">Walker</span> takes his walks abroad he will be
more careful. At least, if his head insists upon meeting swords
going the other way, he may be expected to note whether it is the
sharp edge or the flat that is out for the day.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Financial Clause Home-Rule Bill in Committee.
A long dull night, flashing forth at end in encounter between <span class="sc">Joseph</span>
and his "right hon. friend." Mr. G. in tremendous force and
vigour. In its way it was <span class="sc">Campbell-Bannerman's</span> story over again,
<span class="sc">Joseph's</span> blameless head meeting the sharp edge of Mr. G.'s sword.
Where difference came in was in circumstance that no one seemed
to regard accident as regrettable. On contrary, whilst the Home-Rulers
whooped in wild delight, the Opposition crowded the benches
to watch the fun.</p>

<p><i>Friday</i>, 1.20 <span class="sc">a.m.</span>&mdash;If there is in the world at this moment a
thoroughly astonished man it is <span class="sc">John William Logan</span>, Member of
Parliament for the South (Harborough) division of Leicestershire.
Just now <span class="sc">Logan's</span> mind is disturbed and his collar ruffled by an
incident in the passage of Home-Rule Bill; but he is capable of
giving perfectly coherent account of events. At ten o'clock <span class="sc">Mellor</span>
rose as usual to set in motion machinery of guillotine. Question at
moment before Committee peremptorily put. <span class="sc">Logan</span>, unguardedly
descending from serene atmosphere of side gallery, reached floor of
House; was passing between table and Front Opposition Bench
towards division lobby when he beheld vision of <span class="sc">Vicary Gibbs</span>
skipping down gangway steps shouting and waving his arms.
<span class="sc">Logan</span>, a man of philosophical temperament and inquiring mind,
halted to watch course of events. Something apparently wrong in
the City; things either gone up or gone down; <span class="sc">Vicary Gibbs</span>
certainly come down; was now seated beside <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>, with
hat fiercely pressed over brow, excitedly shouting at Chairman.
As everybody else was shouting at same moment, Chairman wrung
his hands, and spasmodically cried "Order! Order!" <span class="sc">Logan</span> had
presence of mind to note that whilst <span class="sc">Vicary</span> in any pause in the
storm cried aloud, "Mr. <span class="sc">Mellor</span>, I rise to order," he was sitting
down all the time with his hat on.</p>

<p>That was <span class="sc">Logan's</span> last collected idea before personal affairs
entirely engrossed his attention. <span class="sc">Hayes Fisher</span>, in ordinary times
mildest-mannered man that ever helped to govern Ireland, took
note of <span class="sc">Logan</span> still standing in passage between Front Bench and
table; effect upon him miraculous.</p>

<p>"Yah, <span class="sc">Logan</span>!" he yelled; "get out. Bah! bah! go to the Bar."</p>

<p>Contagion of fury touched <span class="sc">Carson</span>, who had hitherto been
shouting at large. He now turned on <span class="sc">Logan</span>. "Gag! gag!" he
yelled. "Gang of gaggers." Then, in heat of moment, he cried
above the uproar, "Gag of gangers."</p>

<p>This too much for <span class="sc">Logan</span>. Hitherto stood everything; now sat
down in contiguity to <span class="sc">Carson</span>. Here is where the surprise came in.
Front Opposition Bench not his usual place, but was nearest
available seat. His standing up objected to; it was certainly
against rules of law and order that prevail in the House of Commons.
Very well then, he would sit down. This he did, taking vacant
place by <span class="sc">Carson</span>. But, like the bo'sun and the sailor strung up for
forty lashes, hit high or hit low he couldn't please them. The scene
that followed has no parallel since similar disturbance took place
in Dotheboys Hall when <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> revolted and "took it
out" of <i>Squeers</i>. <span class="sc">Hayes Fisher</span> leaning over clutched LOGAN by
the back of the neck and thrust him forth. <span class="sc">Ashmead-Bartlett</span>,
seeing opportunity of winning his knightly spurs, firmly fixed his
eyeglass, and felt for <span class="sc">Logan</span> in the front.</p>

<p>That the table and front Opposition Bench were not "steepled" in
<span class="sc">Logan's</span> gore, as were the forms and benches at Dotheboy's Hall
in that of <i>Fanny Squeers's</i> Pa, was due to diversion raised from
another quarter. Irish members below Gangway, seeing the scrimmage,
and noting <span class="sc">Carson</span> had something to do with it, moved down
in body with wild "whirroo!" <span class="sc">Saunderson</span>, providentially in his
place, sprang up and advanced to intercept the rolling flood. <span class="sc">Crean</span>
being on crest of advancing wave found his face, by what
<span class="sc">Campbell-Bannerman</span> would describe as a "regrettable accident."
in contact with the Colonel's fist. Moreover, it was the knuckly
end, scarcely less hurtful than the sharp edge of the sword which
laid <span class="sc">Walker</span> (of London) low. <span class="sc">Crean</span> drew back, but only <i>pour
mieux reculer</i>, as they say in Cork. Whilst the Colonel was standing
in the attitude of pacific impartiality he later described to the
<span class="sc">Speaker</span>, <span class="sc">Crean</span> dealt him an uncommonly nasty one on the chops;
the thud distinctly heard amid the Babel of cries in the miniature
Donnybrook below Gangway. Amid moving, struggling mass,
<span class="sc">Saunderson's</span> white waistcoat flashed to and fro like flag of truce, to
which, alas! there was no response. What became of <span class="sc">Logan</span> in this
crisis not quite clear. Fancy I saw <span class="sc">Walrond</span> extricating him from the
embraces of <span class="sc">Fanny-Squeers-Ashmead-Bartlett</span>. Mr. G. looked on
with troubled face from Treasury Bench. <span class="sc">Bartley</span> standing up on
edge of scrimmage, pointed accusatory forefinger at him, was saying
something, probably opprobrious but at the moment inaudible.</p>

<p>"So like <span class="sc">Bartley</span> to go to root of matter," said <span class="sc">George

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
